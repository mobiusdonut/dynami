        problem: "Steve can fuel his compact car with either regular or premium gas. IfSteve uses regular gas his car gets 27 miles per gallon, but if he usesthe more expensive higher-octane premium gas his car gets 30 miles pergallon. Regular gas is currently $2.70 per gallon. Let the answers belowrepresent the amount by which premium gas costs more than regulargas per gallon. Which of these is the smallest difference in price forpremium that still leaves regular gas a better value?",
